If your id and name member variables are const, you cannot initialize them in the constructor body using assignment statements. 
You must use a member initializer list to initialize them. After the change member variables are being initialized in the constructor initializer list,
, which means that their values are set before the constructor body begins executing.

This is because member initializer lists initialize the member variables directly, without creating temporary objects, 
whereas initializing member variables in the constructor body requires creating temporary objects and then copying or moving (canâ€™t do if const) them into the member variables.
